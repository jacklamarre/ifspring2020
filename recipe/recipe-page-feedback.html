<body>Recipe page looks good and is clear on mobile layout. However, it need more dynamic/interactive elements. I will make the ingredients and preparation sections interactive by being buttons that can be pressed to expand the sections, instead of them being static. I may also make the scrolling active so the image disappears when scrolled past. Feedback was that the page felt static, so adding these improvements should address that. I also think that there could be a better use of font weights. </body>
