		<h1> Jack Lamarre - Intro Questions </h1>


		<ol>
			<li>My name is <b>Jack Lamarre.</b> I am an <b>Art</b> and <b>American Culture Studies Double Major</b> and <b>Human-Computer Interaction Minor.</b> I am a <b>Junior.</b></li>
			
			<p></p>

			<li>I am from <b>San FranciscoM</b> and I want to work in the <b>UI/UX/Product Design</b> field.</li>

			<p></p>

			<li>I do not have any experience with HTML.</li>

			<p></p>

			<li>I hope to learn how to make a website that exemplifies clear and beautiful design.</li>

			<p></p>

			<li>I expect designing for screen will be a less direct process than designing on paper and that it will involve a different style of problem solving that I am used to with designing on paper or with digital tools.</li>

			<li><a href="https://www.carthrottle.com/">Car Throttle</a> </li>
			
			<p></p>

			<li><a href="https://jalopnik.com/">Jalopnik (and sister sites)</a>.</li>
			
			<p></p>

			<li> I chose <a href="https://petrolicious.com/">Petrolicious</a> because I think its use of imagery and a retro-modern aesthetic work well for its content and audience. I chose automotive sites for all three to give comparisons for what an automotive site could look like.</li>
