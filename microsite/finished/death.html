		<h1 id="overview">VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE (A5).</h1>



			<p>The Volkswagen Beetle (also sold as the Volkswagen Käfer, Volkswagen Coccinelle, Volkswagen Maggiolino, Volkswagen Fusca in some countries) is a small family car manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen introduced in 2011 for the 2012 model year, as the successor to the New Beetle launched in 1997. It features a lower profile while retaining an overall shape recalling the original Volkswagen Type 1 Beetle.</p>

			<p>One of Volkswagen's goals with the model was to give it a more aggressive appearance while giving it some stylistic aspects reminiscent of the Type 1. This was an attempt to distance the new model from the New Beetle, produced from 1997 to 2011, which never approached the success of the first Beetle.</p>

			<p>The second generation "new" Beetle shares the "A5" (PQ35) platform with the current generation Volkswagen Jetta and is built alongside the Jetta, Golf Variant and the old Jetta ("Clásico") at Volkswagen's plant in Puebla, Mexico. It is longer than the previous New Beetle at 4,278 mm (168.4 in) and also has a lower profile, 12 mm (0.5 in) lower than its predecessor, and 88 mm (3.5 in) wider. The trunk is now 310 L (11 cu ft), up from 209 L (7.4 cu ft).</p>

			<p>A convertible version followed the coupé for the 2013 model year, first shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2012 when it also went on sale.</p>

			<p>Head of Technical Development for VW, Frank Welsch, indicated at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show that this would be the Beetle's final generation.</p>

			<p>On 13 September 2018, Volkswagen announced that the Beetle would cease production in July 2019. The final third generation Beetle (a denim blue coupe) finished production on 9 July 2019 and rolled off the assembly line on the following day. The model was officially retired at a ceremony in Puebla City later that day.</p>

			<p>Volkswagen claims that the reason for discontinuing the model was to make space for electric vehicles, crossovers, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs)</p>


		
		<h1 id="launch">LAUNCH.</h1>

			<p>At the 1994 North American International Auto Show, Volkswagen unveiled theOn 22 November 2010, on the final episode of the Oprah's Favorite Things special, Oprah Winfrey and Volkswagen announced every audience member that day would receive one of the Beetles upon its release in 2011. VW staff gave the audience their special keys to the car. This was followed by a teaser commercial during Super Bowl XLV in February 2011.</p>

			<p>To celebrate the global reveal, VW partnered with MTV, to make a debut on three continents on 18 April. The reveal began in Shanghai, China with a MTV Sound System celebration hosted by MTV VJs, followed by MTV World Stage events in Berlin and New York City.</p>


			<p>On 18 April 2011, the 2012 model was unveiled as the Volkswagen Beetle, dropping the word "New" from its name. It debuted at the 14th Auto Shanghai and the New York International Auto Show.</p>

			<p>During the marketing campaign at Mexico, it was advertised as "The new Vocho" (oddly in English) in the "Das Auto" marketing campaign.</p>
			
		<h1 id="engines">ENGINES.</h1>

			<p>The new model retains the front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout of the New Beetle, while improving interior packaging with more room in the rear.[11] Four-cylinder engine options for the European market are expected to include 1.2-litre (77 kW (105 PS; 103 bhp)), 1.4-litre (118 kW (160 PS; 158 bhp)) and 2.0-litre (147 kW (200 PS; 197 bhp)) TSI petrol engines, and 1.6-litre (78 kW (106 PS; 105 bhp)) and 2.0-litre (103 kW (140 PS; 138 bhp)) TDI diesel engines. In addition to the 2.0-litre TSI and TDI engines, base North American Beetles were originally fitted with a (125 kW (170 PS; 168 bhp)) straight-five engine (engine code CBTA/CBUA) earlier used on the Golf and Jetta.[4][11][12] From 2015 onward, the 2.5L straight-five was phased out in favor of a 1.8L four-cylinder TSI of comparable horsepower ratings but improved torque ratings over the straight-five.</p>

			<p>All engines for this model are offered with an option of a six-speed manual transmission or the option of a dual-clutch DSG automatic. In the United States, transmissions on petrol models come with either a five-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic on 2.5/1.8T models, while on the diesel models there is the option of a DSG six-speed dual-clutch transmission.</p>


			
			<h1 id="special">SPECIAL EDITIONS.</h1>

			<h1>Black Turbo Launch Edition</h1>

			<p>The first special edition of the 2012 Beetle is the Black Turbo launch edition. It was limited to 600 cars on the U.S. market and will be the first car available through Volkswagen’s new Vehicle Pre-Order program.</p>

			<h1>Turbo Black</h1>

			<p>A Beetle Turbo Black made an appearance at the 30th annual Wörthersee Treffen in June 2011 in Reifnitz, Austria. It was located on the floating barge showcase at the entrance to the show. Other cars on the barge included a Reifnitz Edition GTI and the Touareg Racer. A heavily modified in-house electric-powered Beetle, called E-Bugster, was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. Unlike other new Beetles, the E-Bugster is a two-seater instead of 2+2.</p>

			<h1>Fender Edition</h1>

			<p>In 2012, Volkswagen partnered with Fender Musical Instruments Corporation to release a limited edition Beetle for the 2013 model year. The Beetle Fender Edition uses the Beetle Turbo's front fascia and the 2.5L model's 18" disc wheels. Unique exterior features consist of Fender badges and chrome side mirror covers. The interior features a sunburst dashboard panel that pays homage to the Fender Stratocaster, a 400 watt premium audio system with nine speakers, an LCD screen, and a 10-channel amplifier.</p>

			<h1>Xbox Special Edition</h1>

			<p>In January 2013, an official Xbox special edition was released.

This special edition was available only for the Mexican market.</p>

			<h1>GSR Limited Edition</h1>

			<p>In February 2013 at the Chicago Auto Show, Volkswagen introduced the Beetle GSR Limited Edition. It is painted in yellow and black and only 3,500 will be produced, half of which will be sold in the United States, the other half in Europe. This special edition is modelled after the original 1973 special edition Super Beetle dubbed the GSR or, Gelb Schwarz Renner, Yellow Black Racer in English. It was also the only Volkswagen that was offered with a factory boost gauge. The new GSR comes with Volkswagen's new 2.0l turbo four cylinder, this time making an extra 10 horsepower for a total of 210 hp (157 kW).</p>

Along with increased performance, the new engine is expected to get about 8% greater fuel economy, or around 1–2 more miles per gallon. The engine will be fitted to all Volkswagens that currently use the gen2 2.0l turbo four.</p>

			<p>A version with a rugged off-road look called the 'Beetle Dune' went on sale in 2016. Although four-wheel drive is not available, the car's suspension has been raised by 1.4 centimetres (0.55 in) and an exclusive yellow colour is available as an option.</p>

			<p>The Final Edition is the final version of the model sold in 2019 with two colors that were tributes to past Beetle models: Safari Uni Beige and Stonewashed Blue. Three other colors offered are Platinum Grey, Pure White, and Deep Black Pearl. The Final Edition came in both coupe and convertible body styles. There are two trims: SE and SEL.</p>
