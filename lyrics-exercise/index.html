		<h1>IN MY ROOM - Frank Ocean</h1>
		<body>
			<p>Sleeper seats, that's a mattress
			<br>No sleeper seats, that's a mattress (sleep)
			<br>You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
			<br>You won't flinch when camera flashin', flashin'
			<br>Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
			<br>And I think you made for the life I lead
			<br>I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick
			<br>That kinda coffin don't need lean, rest in peace
			<br>Got this lust for life in me
			<br>Horny for the game, uh
			<br>First they kiss, then they bite soft (uh)
			<br>Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
			<br>Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
			<br>While serpents shake some brand new scales
			<br>I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
			<br>Acting familiar, took all the rock
			<br>And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
			<br>And he ungrateful, they don't say, "Thank you"
			<br>They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
			<br>Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
			<br>Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
			<br>Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
			<br>Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
			<br>That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
			<br>And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
			<br>Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill, it's either real or real
			<br>Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
			<br>Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
			<br>Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
			<br>Rocket f-
			<br>Quit being violent with me (yeah, why, why)
			<br>Quit being violent with me
			<br>Quit being violent with me
			<br>You make me violent
			<br>My room, my room, my room with me
			<br>Every night you were in my room
			<br>My room, my room with me
			<br>I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
			<br>I don't know you
			<br>And I can't put no threats in the air</p>
