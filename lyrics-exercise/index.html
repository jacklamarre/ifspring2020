		<h1>IN MY ROOM - Frank Ocean</h1>
		<body>
			<p>sleeper seats, that's a mattress</p>
			<p>No sleeper seats, that's a mattress (sleep)</p>
			<p>You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
			You won't flinch when camera flashin', flashin'
			Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
			And I think you made for the life I lead
			I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick
			That kinda coffin don't need lean, rest in peace
			Got this lust for life in me
			Horny for the game, uh
			First they kiss, then they bite soft (uh)
			Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
			Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
			While serpents shake some brand new scales
			I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
			Acting familiar, took all the rock
			And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
			And he ungrateful, they don't say, "Thank you"
			They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
			Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
			Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
			Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
			Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
			That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
			And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
			Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill, it's either real or real
			Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
			Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
			Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
			Rocket f-
			Quit being violent with me (yeah, why, why)
			Quit being violent with me
			Quit being violent with me
			You make me violent
			My room, my room, my room with me
			Every night you were in my room
			My room, my room with me
			I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
			I don't know you
			And I can't put no threats in the air</p>
